# Programming-Technology
My educational projects

Projects I have developed during my Programming classes
List of projects:
1. Huffman algoritm for coding file
2. Red-Black tree realization
3. Fast Fourier Transform for multiplying polynomials
4. Paralleling Gaussian elimination

Most of realizations were based by "Introduction to Algorithms" Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein
During the classes i studied and developed Data structures as vectors, lists, queues, sets, binary trees, hash-tables and algorithms as heap sort, Huffman coding, Divide and Conquer strategy, graph algorithms
